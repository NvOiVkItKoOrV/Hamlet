57 <  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.>
42 <    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,>
47 <      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head>
43 <      Which was declining on the milky head>
41 <    With all my imperfections on my head.>
47 <    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,>
45 <    He took my father grossly, full of bread,>
46 <    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,>
23 <  Ham. How came he mad?>
30 <  Pol. That hath made him mad.>
24 <  Queen. Alas, he's mad!>
43 <    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.>
45 <    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?>
51 <    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,>
41 <    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,>
39 <    Will sate itself in a celestial bed>
43 <      When second husband kisses me in bed.>
46 <    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;>
69 <  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.>
40 <    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed>
45 <    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.>
45 <    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;>
48 <              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'>
30 <           Go to thy deathbed;>
69 <    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided>
20 <    To be commanded.>
35 <  Pol. This business is well ended.>
52 <  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.>
48 <  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.>
22 <  Mar. It is offended.>
49 <  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,>
44 <    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?>
45 <    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed>
50 <    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed>
46 <    To show yourself your father's son in deed>
21 <  King. O heavy deed!>
47 <  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.>
37 <  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.>
49 <    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed>
43 <    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed>
27 <    Stick fiery off indeed.>
48 <  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed>
49 <  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.>
35 <    A combination and a form indeed>
56 <   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.>
27 <  Queen. So he does indeed.>
47 <    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed>
50 <    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,>
42 <    To keep it from divulging, let it feed>
37 <  King. She sounds to see them bleed.>
67 <  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.>
49 <    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed>
46 <    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,>
63 <    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,>
67 <    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died>
47 <    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,>
62 <    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified>
23 <    To the unsatisfied.>
38 <    I did repel his letters and denied>
50 <    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,>
54 <    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,>
34 <    Her mood will needs be pitied.>
41 <  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'>
51 <    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled>
45 <    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red>
19 <  Ham. Pale or red?>
30 <    Be all my sins rememb'red.>
58 <  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.>
68 <    hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred>
45 <    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,>
42 <    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.>
46 <    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,>
47 <    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated>
66 <    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated>
67 <  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;>
42 <                 Enter Ophelia distracted.>
51 <  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,>
56 <      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,>
53 <      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,>
53 <  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!>
35 <    Which now goes too free-footed.>
63 <  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.>
48 <    The memory be green, and that it us befitted>
40 <    Or like a creature native and indued>
31 <  Oph. I was the more deceived.>
47 <      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;>
38 <              You promis'd me to wed.'>
41 <    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.>
52 <    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.>
44 <            Let in the maid, that out a maid>
55 <    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,>
65 <    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said>
47 <    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.>
45 <    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,>
51 <    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid>
22 <  Hor. My lord, I did;>
30 <    Come short of what he did.>
53 <  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,>
40 <    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,>
40 <    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,>
25 <    man is twice a child.>
41 <    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild>
47 <    A little month, or ere those shoes were old>
69 <  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old>
45 <    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,>
42 <    To mine own room again; making so bold>
54 <  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,>
47 <  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.>
27 <    To what I shall unfold.>
68 <  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold>
49 <    Should have a back or second, that might hold>
10 <    world.>
45 <    I do not know from what part of the world>
35 <  Laer. My will, not all the world!>
47 <    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world>
42 <    Seem to me all the uses of this world!>
43 <    In the corrupted currents of this world>
65 <  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could>
60 <    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'>
47 <    That treason can but peep to what it would,>
66 <    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would>
61 <  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and>
67 <  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and>
65 <  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and>
61 <    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and>
69 <    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and>
67 <    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and>
64 <  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and>
62 <    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and>
69 <    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and>

65 <    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and>
64 <    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and>
46 <    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand>
26 <  Laer. Know you the hand?>
49 <    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand>
40 <    But to recover of us, by strong hand>
38 <    If by direct or by collateral hand>
45 <    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand>
49 <    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!>
46 <    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,>
45 <    So nightly toils the subject of the land,>
44 <         And hath shipped me intil the land,>
46 <    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.>
48 <    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;>
51 <  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England>
48 <    I cannot live to hear the news from England,>
51 <    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,>
52 <    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England>
17 <    into England.>
47 <  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?>
16 <    For England.>
19 <  Ham. For England?>
52 <    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!>
60 <  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!>
36 <  Capt. Against some part of Poland.>
56 <  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,>
44 <    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,>
47 <    Th' important acting of your dread command?>
49 <  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,>
46 <    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;>
46 <    Put your dread pleasures more into command>
41 <    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,>
64 <  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand>
62 <  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand>
31 <    pick'd out of ten thousand.>
44 <    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,>
54 <    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand>
32 <  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.>
8 <    end.>
38 <    died. They say he made a good end.>
41 <    No more; and by a sleep to say we end>
44 <    And each particular hair to stand an end>
48 <    As make your bouts more violent to that end->
50 <      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,>
46 <    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,>
49 <    And You must put me in your heart for friend,>
16 <    your friend.>
12 <    Perpend.>
46 <    I, his sole son, do this same villain send>
45 <      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,>
52 <  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.>
50 <  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;>
50 <  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend>
41 <    If circumstances lead me, I will find>
52 <      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,>
46 <    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.>
37 <    I must be cruel, only to be kind;>
58 <  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!>
46 <      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind>
49 <    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.>
48 <    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?>

48 <    With all the strength and armour of the mind>

65 <    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind>
43 <    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,>
45 <    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,>
29 <    And for his death no wind>
54 <    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound>
44 <  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound>
45 <    And, like a man to double business bound,>
44 <    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found>
48 <    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found>
42 <    But better look'd into, he truly found>
44 <    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound>
30 <  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.>
57 <    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round>
51 <      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,>
42 <    It waves you to a more removed ground.>
67 <    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.>
42 <    We go to gain a little patch of ground>
45 <    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,>
50 <  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.>
30 <  Hor. Friends to this ground.>
24 <  Ham. Upon what ground?>
48 <    Your party in converse, him you would sound,>
49 <    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!>
31 <  Laer. Do you see this, O God?>
13 <  Ham. O God!>
66 <    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,>
62 <  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god>
12 <  Ham. Good.>
52 <    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,>
44 <    That to the use of actions fair and good>
64 <  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good>
46 <    No medicine in the world can do thee good.>
47 <    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.>
42 <    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.>
67 <  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good>
65 <    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good>
43 <  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.>
38 <    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,>
52 <    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,>
53 <    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,>
42 <    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;>
53 <    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.>
50 <    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,>
56 <    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood>
42 <    Excitements of my reason and my blood,>
30 <    Repast them with my blood.>
44 <    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;>
45 <      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,>
34 <  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!>
68 <    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card>
55 <    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard>
40 <    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard>
47 <    Never to speak of this that you have heard:>
47 <    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard>
44 <    As did that one; and that, in my regard,>
48 <  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;>
50 <    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard>
48 <    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,>
48 <    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,>
56 <  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.>
60 <  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;>
61 <      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard>
32 <  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?>
65 <    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.>
44 <    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?>

22 <  Laer. My dread lord,>
20 <  Mar. My good lord!>
37 <  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?>
42 <  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.>
25 <  Rey. But, my good lord->
24 <  Osr. Ay, my good lord.>
49 <  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,>

53 <    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;>
25 <  Ros. My most dear lord!>
23 <  Hor. O, my dear lord!>
30 <  Guil. In what, my dear lord?>
66 <  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!>
15 <  Oph. My lord?>
22 <  Mar. Nor I, my lord.>
22 <  Pol. Not I, my lord.>
23 <  Both. Arm'd, my lord.>
48 <  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,>
18 <    read, my lord?>
49 <  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.>
28 <  Ros. To what end, my lord?>
26 <  Rey. Very good, my lord.>
54 <  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,>
33 <  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!>
35 <  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.>
41 <  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?>
37 <  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?>
31 <  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?>
24 <  Oph. At home, my lord.>
34 <  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!>
19 <    There, my lord.>
25 <  Hor. O, where, my lord?>
31 <  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.>
33 <  Pol. That's very true, my lord.>
48 <  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.>
23 <  Pol. I have, my lord.>
27 <  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.>
31 <  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:>
25 <  Guil. A thing, my lord?>
32 <  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.>
26 <  Rey. As gaming, my lord.>
57 <  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,>
33 <  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.>
24 <  Rey. I shall, my lord.>
25 <  Ros. We shall, my lord.>

24 <  Hor. E'en so, my lord.>
32 <  Ros. We think not so, my lord.>
41 <  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.>
24 <  Ros. Neither, my lord.>

35 <  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?>
41 <   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?>
54 <  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.>

35 <  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.>
45 <    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word>
45 <    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:>
32 <  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.>
42 <    The ratifiers and props of every word,>
61 <    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,>
54 <      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,>
52 <      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword>
51 <      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword>
53 <      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,>
38 <  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.>
21 <  Ham. Upon my sword.>
43 <    And lay your hands again upon my sword.>
46 <    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.>
22 <    Swear by my sword.>
22 <    Swear by my sword.>
45 <    But even then the morning cock crew loud,>
69 <  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be>
10 <  Ber. He.>

44 <    Till then in patience our proceeding be.>
39 <    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be>
69 <  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be>
39 <    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;>
42 <    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be>
61 <    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be>

50 <      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,>
43 <    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.>
52 <    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,>
41 <    I have a voice and precedent of peace>
43 <    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,>
33 <  Ham. Then saw you not his face?>
36 <  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.>
39 <    He falls to such perusal of my face>
48 <    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?>
20 <    Get you a place.>
50 <    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,>
41 <    As he in his particular act and place>
49 <    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,>
31 <  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.>

41 <    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.>
48 <    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;>
51 <    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice>
48 <    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,>
44 <    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice>
47 <    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,>
40 <    So, by my former lecture and advice,>
49 <    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,>
43 <    Break we our watch up; and by my advice>
37 <    To exploit now ripe in my device,>
41 <  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.>
64 <    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.>
17 <    O, vengeance!>
50 <    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,>
47 <    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,>
56 <    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance>
56 <    And that our drift look through our bad performance.>

46 <    Her brother is in secret come from France;>
46 <    Your leave and favour to return to France;>
33 <    As fits a king's remembrance.>
52 <  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance>
41 <    You do remember all the circumstance?>
48 <    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,>
47 <  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance>
43 <    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.>
52 <    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.>
43 <    On such regards of safety and allowance>

42 <    But to confront the visage of offence?>
46 <    That both the world, I give to negligence,>
56 <    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence>

55 <    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience>
57 <    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!>

52 <    Importing health and graveness. Two months since>
30 <  Ham. How long is that since?>
63 <  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once>
51 <    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.>
57 <    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.>
33 <  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.>

28 <  Queen. Have you forgot me?>
65 <  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?>
47 <    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.>
32 <    In noise so rude against me?>

44 <    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.>

47 <    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,>
48 <    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time>

21 <  Ham. In happy time.>

19 <    To any pastime?>
9 <    Come.>
9 <    Rome->
45 <    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,>

42 <    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.>
69 <    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!>
46 <    There with fantastic garlands did she come>
54 <    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!>
41 <    To let this canker of our nature come>
50 <    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.>
68 <    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:>
51 <  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!>
40 <    That, if again this apparition come,>
46 <    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;>
48 <  Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?>
32 <  Ghost. My hour is almost come,>
13 <    But come!>
34 <  Ham. He will stay till you come.>
51 <    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come>
68 <  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.>
23 <  Ham. You are welcome.>
51 <  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.>
47 <    Will return'd shall know you are come home.>
48 <    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home>
58 <    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;>

11 <  Ham. One.>
43 <    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.>

48 <    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,>
48 <    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine->
51 <  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,>
57 <  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;>
44 <    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?>
45 <    I made to her in marriage, and to decline>
9 <    mine.>
21 <    To those of mine!>
46 <    And I do think- or else this brain of mine>
47 <    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),>
45 <  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,>

48 <      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!>
42 <    If there be any good thing to be done,>
43 <    With sore distraction. What I have done>
49 <    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.>

35 <  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?>
43 <    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,>
34 <              He is dead and gone;>

45 <    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.>

47 <    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.>
46 <    To keep itself from noyance; but much more>
62 <  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more>
53 <    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.>
12 <    No more.>
17 <  Queen. No more!>
47 <    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.>
41 <         'One fair daughter, and no more,>
26 <    eyes. Prithee no more!>
32 <  Queen. O, speak to me no more!>
33 <  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!>
25 <  Laer. Think it no more.>
54 <    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.>
41 <    Makes vow before his uncle never more>
69 <  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more>
13 <    Elsinore.>
17 <SCENE.- Elsinore.>
40 <    But what is your affair in Elsinore?>
14 <Near Elsinore.>
25 <    make you at Elsinore?>
22 <    Within the centre.>
42 <    The terms of our estate may not endure>
46 <    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!>
57 <    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?>
48 <    Well may it sort that this portentous figure>
41 <    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure>
56 <  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.>
69 <  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.>
54 <  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.>
42 <    Have you so slander any moment leisure>
38 <    Exposing what is mortal and unsure>
68 <    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,>
50 <    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,>
48 <    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature>
50 <    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature>
49 <    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature>
33 <  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,>
41 <    So crimeful and so capital in nature,>
55 <    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature>
48 <    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,>
42 <    A violet in the youth of primy nature,>
69 <  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?>
35 <    Among a mineral of metals base,>
49 <    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,>
48 <    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;>
42 <    But, like the owner of a foul disease,>
13 <      phrase.>
50 <    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase>
46 <    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,>
49 <    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,>
40 <  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?>
46 <    Last, and as such containing as all these,>
48 <    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.>
54 <    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,>
55 <    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,>
41 <    For food and diet, to some enterprise>
47 <    Through your dominions for this enterprise,>
50 <    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,>

66 <    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else>
69 <    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else>
47 <    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,>
52 <  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?>
27 <  Laer. What ceremony else?>
27 <  Laer. What ceremony else?>
10 <    sense.>
50 <    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,>
42 <    Or but a sickly part of one true sense>
42 <    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,>
46 <    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense>
55 <    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense>
47 <    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.>
53 <    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those>
66 <    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those>

48 <      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.>
45 <    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose>
46 <    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose>
49 <    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!>
46 <      What to ourselves in passion we propose,>
46 <    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.>
66 <    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,>
46 <    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose>
45 <    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.>
48 <    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse>
50 <         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,>
31 <  Oph. Still better, and worse.>
40 <    In obstinate condolement is a course>
67 <    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course>
50 <    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?>
51 <    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,>
41 <    I had my father's signet in my purse,>
49 <    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;>
45 <    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,>
45 <    For this effect defective comes by cause.>
47 <    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,>
46 <    That your good beauties be the happy cause>
53 <      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,>
67 <    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse>
44 <    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house>
43 <    To tell the secrets of my prison house,>
51 <    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;>
51 <    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;>
55 <  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,>
44 <    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,>
62 <  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late>
45 <      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,>
52 <    What, have you given him any hard words of late?>
41 <    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late>
47 <    And our affairs from England come too late.>
55 <  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.>
39 <    My liege, and madam, to expostulate>
42 <    Set your entreatments at a higher rate>
39 <    Let me be no assistant for a state,>
49 <    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,>
46 <    The safety and health of this whole state,>
22 <    Of his true state.>
51 <      So far from cheer and from your former state.>
46 <    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,>
50 <    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.>
42 <    As it doth well appear unto our state,>
44 <    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.>
44 <    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite>
47 <    As of a father; for let the world take note>
46 <    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;>
41 <    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note>
31 <    Th' effect of what I wrote?>
48 <    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.>
55 <    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.>
48 <    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste>
48 <    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste>
44 <    For the demand of our neglected tribute.>
41 <    The pith and marrow of our attribute.>
43 <    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;>
49 <  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.>
52 <  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.>
53 <    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,>
43 <    Give it an understanding but no tongue.>
57 <  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue>
50 <    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!>
37 <                      Enter Prologue.>
46 <    This above all- to thine own self be true,>
33 <  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!>
49 <  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;>
22 <  Pol. 'Tis most true;>
47 <    Collected from all simples that have virtue>
51 <    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;>
68 <  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave>
65 <    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?>
40 <    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.>
47 <    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.>
33 <  Laer. I pray you give me leave.>
52 <  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave>
23 <  Rey. My lord, I have.>
29 <  Queen. What would she have?>
47 <    And makes us rather bear those ills we have>
54 <    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,>
68 <    first mouth'd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you have>
62 <    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have>
44 <    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.>
29 <    But he's an arrant knave.>
46 <    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,>

57 <  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave>
64 <                                             Leaps in the grave.>
44 <    To outface me with leaping in her grave?>
51 <    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,>
35 <    And not have strew'd thy grave.>
21 <  Ham. Into my grave?>
69 <    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe>
45 <  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe>
46 <  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe>
42 <    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve>
26 <    pound! Didst perceive?>
64 <    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give>
51 <    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,>
65 <    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give>
44 <    And thy commandment all alone shall live>
23 <  Ham. Nay, but to live>
53 <    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.>
49 <    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive>
53 <  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.>
44 <    I could not but by her. The other motive>
48 <    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,>
34 <  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.>
44 <    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.>
39 <    Anon, as patient as the female dove>
27 <    Fare you well, my dove!>
50 <       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,>
64 <  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,>
35 <            But never doubt I love.>
42 <       In youth when I did love, did love,>
45 <    I do receive your offer'd love like love,>
54 <      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.>
45 <    There lives within the very flame of love>
52 <      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.>
42 <    As meditation or the thoughts of love,>
37 <    This is the very ecstasy of love,>
37 <    And with no less nobility of love>
47 <    Could not (with all their quantity of love)>
50 <    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love>
47 <  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love>
44 <    If thou didst ever thy dear father love->
47 <    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.>
48 <    This mad young man. But so much was our love>
23 <  Ham. As woman's love.>
13 <    his love.>
22 <    Receiv'd his love?>
47 <    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,>
24 <  Pol. Mad for thy love?>
50 <    Queen. The instances that second marriage move>
41 <            Doubt that the sun doth move;>
40 <    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move>
59 <    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move>
47 <      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,>
40 <    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.>
31 <  Guil. Faith, her privates we.>
44 <    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe>
50 <    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe>
43 <    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,>
29 <  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!>
42 <    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,>
46 <    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!>
43 <    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,>
48 <    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,>
45 <    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,>
28 <    As day does to your eye.>
46 <  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.>
41 <    We shall express our duty in his eye;>
40 <    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.>
50 <    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze>
51 <  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;>
58 <  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.>
68 <    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief>
45 <  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief>
52 <    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,>
48 <  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,>
44 <    The origin and commencement of his grief>
48 <    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;>
37 <         By his cockle bat and' staff>
42 <    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff>
33 <    My head should be struck off.>
65 <                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.>
51 <                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.>
50 <  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,>
64 <                                                   are shot off.>
12 <    not off.>
38 <    If it be made of penetrable stuff;>
69 <    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if>
69 <    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for England- if>

48 <    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;>
46 <    So much from th' understanding of himself,>

22 <    The Devil himself.>
60 <    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.>
39 <    It is a poison temper'd by himself.>
44 <    When down her weedy trophies and herself>
45 <    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,>
50 <  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.>
43 <  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.>
47 <    Given private time to you, and you yourself>
45 <    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself>
45 <    It sends some precious instance of itself>
53 <  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,>
37 <    Being a thing immortal as itself?>
41 <    Whose violent property fordoes itself>
52 <    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.>
30 <  Hor. As thou art to thyself.>
60 <    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?>
29 <    purpose, confess thyself->
45 <    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,>

36 <    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.>
36 <    That to Laertes I forgot myself,>

13 <    the King.>
51 <    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King>
31 <  Mar. Is it not like the King?>
45 <    There is a play to-night before the King.>
26 <  Ber. Long live the King!>
49 <  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.>
44 <  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,>
48 <    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.>
45 <    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.>
51 <    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King->
64 <    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.>
39 <  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?>
11 <Enter King.>
31 <                    Enter King.>
63 <    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing>
60 <  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.>
46 <    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.>
46 <    What company, at what expense; and finding>

50 <      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;>
24 <    The King is a thing->
49 <    More relative than this. The play's the thing>
22 <    tell me one thing.>
43 <    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?>
67 <    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing>
47 <  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing>
69 <  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something>
15 <  Ham. Nothing.>
18 <      Did nothing.>
27 <  Ber. I have seen nothing.>
51 <    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!>
53 <    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,>
51 <    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;>
43 <    There's such divinity doth hedge a king>
14 <    of a king?>
24 <  Queen. As kill a king?>
44 <    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,>
48 <    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'>
21 <    O thou vile king,>
50 <  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.>
42 <    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'>
43 <    Both to my God and to my gracious king;>
60 <  Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.>
49 <    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,>
44 <  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.>
45 <    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,>
17 <    grave-making?>
34 <    This man shall set me packing.>
53 <    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,>
47 <    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?>
65 <    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling>
55 <  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,>
28 <    When thou liest howling.>
30 <    In censure of his seeming.>
68 <  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.>
38 <  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?>
45 <    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,>
64 <  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]>
69 <    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing>
34 <    His silence will sit drooping.>
49 <    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,>
49 <  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?>
54 <    The ears are senseless that should give us bearing>
50 <  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing>
67 <    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring>
46 <    The canker galls the infants of the spring>
29 <  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.>
49 <    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.>
52 <  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting>
50 <    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting>
47 <    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;>
46 <    And sure I am two men there are not living>
48 <    Most generous, and free from all contriving,>
45 <    When I had seen this hot love on the wing>
68 <    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,>
54 <    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,>
48 <  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;>
25 <    the puppets dallying.>
24 <  Pol. This is too long.>
47 <    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;>
44 <  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?>
41 <    Therefore I have entreated him along,>
55 <  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;>
50 <  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?>
45 <    Believe so much in him, that he is young,>
16 <    are unwrung.>
49 <    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?>

68 <  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'>
25 <  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!>
43 <  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?>
58 <    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?>
42 <    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,>
50 <    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;>
41 <    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,>

22 <  Hor. A piece of him.>
55 <    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;>
28 <  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?>

69 <      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,>
50 <    Is the great love the general gender bear him,>
38 <  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!>
52 <    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him>
49 <    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.>
25 <    Speak loudly for him.>
41 <  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.>

56 <    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him>
68 <  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,>
29 <  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.>
26 <  Queen. Did you assay him>
24 <  Queen. But not by him!>
51 <  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.>

46 <    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,>
50 <    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,>
47 <    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,>
38 <    In filial obligation for some term>
44 <    Together with that fair and warlike form>
46 <    And there assume some other, horrible form>
47 <    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,>
64 <    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;>
63 <  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform>
47 <      But, as we often see, against some storm,>
43 <    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.>

46 <    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,>
43 <    So much as from occasion you may glean,>
45 <    To cast thee up again. What may this mean>
30 <    That I might be the organ.>
66 <    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,>
15 <    Speak, man.>
41 <    To give the world assurance of a man.>
44 <    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,>
23 <  Ham. As th'art a man,>
45 <  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.>
43 <  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man>
28 <    The unseen good old man.>
44 <    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man>

49 <    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen>
43 <    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,>
33 <    What we two nights have seen.>
49 <  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.>
49 <    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,>

55 <    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between>
69 <    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between>

32 <  King. Will you know them then?>
23 <  Ham. What woman then?>
50 <      But if the gods themselves did see her then,>
38 <    Be you and I behind an arras then.>
20 <    O heavy burthen!>
69 <    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien>

46 <  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen>

47 <    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;>
45 <    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,>
50 <    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,>
47 <    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,>
38 <    As oft as any passion under heaven>

66 <  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in>
64 <    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in>
24 <  Hor. Let them come in.>
25 <  Queen. Let her come in.>

30 <    your bounty. Take them in.>
52 <  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.>
65 <  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in>
66 <  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in>
69 <  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in>

10 <    again.>
20 <  Laer. Well, again!>
41 <    I shall not look upon his like again.>
34 <         He never will come again.>

40 <                      Enter Ghost again.>
40 <    Would have reverted to my bow again,>
43 <    Will bring him to his wonted way again,>
33 <  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!>
52 <    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;>
48 <    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!>
58 <    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!>
50 <    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!>
29 <  Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.>
30 <  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!>
46 <    That he which hath your noble father slain>
47 <    But in battalions! First, her father slain;>
42 <    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,>
51 <  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;>
45 <  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,>
42 <    And we beseech you, bend you to remain>
52 <    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,>
48 <  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.>
32 <    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,>
43 <    Within the book and volume of my brain,>
41 <    Without more motive, into every brain>

28 <  Hor. That is most certain.>
48 <    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain>
53 <  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.>
48 <      And never come mischance between us twain!>
24 <  Ham. Up from my cabin,>
43 <    To his confine; and of the truth herein>
49 <    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.>
44 <    And, as the world were now but to begin,>
47 <    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,>

45 <    And after we will both our judgments join>
43 <    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,>
26 <  King. Our son shall win.>
38 <    Such was the very armour he had on>
39 <    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.>
31 <    Give us the foils. Come on.>

66 <  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.>
20 <  For. Go softly on.>
51 <    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.>
45 <    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon>
26 <    In honourable fashion.>
15 <    A scullion!>
46 <    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,>
48 <  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.>
51 <    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,>
44 <    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,>
28 <    Into a tow'ring passion.>

33 <    against their own succession.>
49 <    When we would bring him on to some confession>

47 <    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,>

69 <  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation>
30 <    And gem of all the nation.>
56 <    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation>
43 <  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.>
33 <    I have in quick determination>
39 <    To show my duty in your coronation,>
44 <    The very place puts toys of desperation,>
29 <    amazement and admiration.>

40 <    So horridly to shake our disposition>
49 <  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.>
49 <    That might your nature, honour, and exception>
48 <    Shall in the general censure take corruption>
34 <    went to cuffs in the question.>
49 <  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:>
47 <    By this encompassment and drift of question>
35 <    That I must call't in question.>
49 <    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,>
41 <    And thus the native hue of resolution>
68 <    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,>
41 <    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,>
68 <  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.>
46 <    For what we know must be, and is as common>
31 <  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.>
44 <    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon>
32 <           And his sandal shoon.>
48 <    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon>
43 <    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,>

67 <    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do>
52 <      My operant powers their functions leave to do.>
44 <    My stern effects. Then what I have to do>
45 <    And let them know both what we mean to do>
47 <    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'>
49 <    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,>
67 <    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do>
39 <    He may not, as unvalued persons do,>
41 <    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,>
43 <    I once did hold it, as our statists do,>
40 <  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.>
48 <  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:>
66 <    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do>
53 <  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.>
49 <    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?>
28 <Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.>
52 <  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,>
64 <                                                  Exit Reynaldo.>

17 <  Fran. Bernardo?>
49 <          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.>
48 <    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,>
42 <    I do beseech you give him leave to go.>
20 <    But let that go.>
45 <         Which bewept to the grave did not go>
34 <  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.>
40 <    Why to a public count I might not go>
13 <    Gonzago'?>
69 <  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.>
35 <    As infinite as man may undergo->
10 <    O, ho!>
35 <  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!>
19 <    Help, help, ho!>
69 <  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who>
68 <    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who>
16 <  Ham. Saw? who?>
19 <  Ham. Between who?>
50 <    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio>
67 <    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,>
25 <  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!>
33 <  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.>
47 <    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?>
55 <    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,>
25 <  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!>
52 <  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,>
52 <  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.>
28 <  Mar. Question it, Horatio.>
48 <  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.>
41 <    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!>

69 <  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no>
68 <    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no>
26 <  Ham. How if I answer no?>
46 <    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,>
40 <    me, whether you were sent for or no.>
62 <    more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no>
67 <  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no>
62 <    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no>
31 <  Ham. The point envenom'd too?>
60 <  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.>
30 <  Hor. Let him bless thee too.>
68 <    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too>
50 <    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,>
65 <    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too>
42 <  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.>
37 <  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;>
65 <    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.>
58 <    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;>
28 <  Other. Why, 'tis found so.>
23 <  King. It shall be so.>
23 <  Laer. Let this be so.>
47 <    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,>
43 <    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.>
66 <    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so>
47 <  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.>
15 <  Hor. E'en so.>
42 <  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.>
37 <  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?>
48 <    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?>
56 <  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.>
66 <    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so>
45 <      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.>
42 <    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'>
47 <    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.>
47 <    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,>
42 <    If damned custom have not braz'd it so>
41 <    The rather, if you could devise it so>
31 <  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!>
60 <  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so>
22 <  Oph. No more but so?>
24 <    And let him know so.>
55 <    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.>
42 <  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,>
66 <  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to>
28 <  Ber. It would be spoke to.>
69 <    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to>
69 <    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to>
66 <    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to>
68 <    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to>
15 <  Other. Go to!>
49 <  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!>
68 <    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to>
66 <    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to>
68 <  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to>
68 <  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to>
65 <  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to>
68 <    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to>
67 <      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to>

64 <  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two>
64 <  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.>
37 <  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?>
37 <  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?>
50 <  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep>
54 <    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,>
33 <      The tedious day with sleep.>
44 <    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.>
47 <    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep->
42 <    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,>
52 <         For some must watch, while some must sleep:>
48 <    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;>
43 <    To try conclusions, in the basket creep>
44 <  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,>
29 <  Hor. Hail to your lordship!>
42 <  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.>
32 <  Oph. What means your lordship?>
43 <  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!>
47 <    For out o' doors he went without their help>
43 <    The bark is ready and the wind at help,>
48 <    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,>
69 <    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top>
49 <      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top>
40 <    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,>
31 <    You mainly were stirr'd up.>
46 <    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;>
67 <    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up>
47 <    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;>
46 <  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.>
48 <      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up->
21 <    Give him the cup.>
45 <    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear>
48 <    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear>
26 <    All given to mine ear.>
48 <    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,>
65 <  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.>
43 <    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear>
53 <    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,>
42 <         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,>
36 <  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?>
56 <      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;>
41 <    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,>
43 <    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.>
43 <    For we will fetters put upon this fear,>
46 <    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,>
53 <    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.>
34 <  Ham. For God's love let me hear!>
32 <  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?>
33 <  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.>
49 <  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.>
54 <  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.>
50 <    How these things came about. So shall You hear>
52 <    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?>
52 <    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear>
43 <    The glowworm shows the matin to be near>
50 <    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.>
37 <  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.>
45 <         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.>
50 <    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear>
10 <    Swear.>

68 <    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar>
45 <    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:>
35 <          Doubt truth to be a liar;>
45 <    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,>
44 <    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star>
46 <    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.>
44 <    The soldiers' music and the rites of war>
43 <    And foreign mart for implements of war;>
37 <    And pious action we do sugar o'er>
53 <    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.>
30 <  Ham. I beseech you remember.>
21 <  Marcellus, Officer.>
20 <  Bernardo, officer.>
21 <  Marcellus, officer.>
56 <    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!>
49 <    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]>
53 <  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.>
49 <      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder>
28 <  King. Pluck thein asunder.>
52 <    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,>
44 <    And, as I think, they have already order>
45 <    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer>
23 <    You know the wager?>

23 <  Both. Longer, longer.>
44 <  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.>
54 <    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,>
61 <  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her>
35 <  Queen. I will not speak with her.>
56 <    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.>
61 <    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her>
38 <  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?>
42 <    To sing a requiem and such rest to her>
46 <    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?>
27 <  Ghost of Hamlet's Father.>
11 <    father?>

32 <  King. Conceit upon her father.>
53 <    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,>
54 <  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;>
37 <  Hor. My lord, the King your father.>
49 <    To give these mourning duties to your father;>
32 <    Requite him for your father.>
45 <    The apparition comes. I knew your father.>
48 <    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.>
40 <    My father- methinks I see my father.>
51 <    My father's brother, but no more like my father>
22 <    Give me my father!>

33 <    Nay, come, let's go together.>

51 <    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.>
26 <  Clown. For none neither.>

47 <    The death I gave him. So again, good night.>
28 <  Fran. Give you good night.>
44 <    In the dead vast and middle of the night>
48 <    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,>
45 <    'Tis now the very witching time of night,>
53 <  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night>
47 <    With us to watch the minutes of this night,>
55 <    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,>
47 <    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.>
32 <    Hold you the watch to-night?>
29 <  Ham. I will watch to-night.>
49 <    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!>
44 <    Let us impart what we have seen to-night>
52 <  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.>
52 <  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?>
43 <    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,>
43 <    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,>
46 <  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.>
40 <  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!>
23 <  King. It falls right.>
41 <    That ever I was born to set it right!>
46 <    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright>
45 <    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?>
32 <    And vanish'd from our sight.>
46 <    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,>
28 <  Fort. Where is this sight?>
48 <    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,>
52 <    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,->
27 <    I never gave you aught.>
55 <    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,>
50 <    But in our circumstance and course of thought,>
51 <    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,>
53 <    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought>
29 <  Pol. Marry, well bethought!>
47 <    But answer made it none. Yet once methought>
54 <    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.>
69 <    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it>
49 <  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.>
61 <  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it>
32 <  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.>
65 <    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it>
16 <  Ham. So be it!>
65 <    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it>
47 <    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,>
47 <    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;>
44 <    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it>
24 <  Hor. Never believe it.>
25 <  Ham. Do not believe it.>
49 <  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.>
44 <    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.>
43 <    And draw you into madness? Think of it.>
43 <  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,>
69 <    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it>
26 <    To let you know of it.>
46 <    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.>
26 <    And will not wrong it.>
47 <    Than your particular demands will touch it.>
49 <    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,>
26 <    But do not go with it!>
41 <  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,>
58 <  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?>
68 <  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.->
30 <  Ham. No, you will reveal it.>
45 <    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,>
68 <    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?>
29 <  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.>
50 <    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;>
42 <    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,>
49 <               A table and flagons of wine on it.>
44 <    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.>
31 <  Ham. Did you not speak to it?>
27 <    But truly I do fear it.>
32 <  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,>
41 <    And am most sensibly in grief for it,>
20 <  Ham. Whose was it?>
46 <    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.>
47 <    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it>
46 <    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,>
29 <  Hor. Heaven will direct it.>
48 <  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.>
44 <    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.>
23 <  King. We will try it.>
25 <    very liberal conceit.>
46 <    Could force his soul so to his own conceit>
45 <    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit>
42 <    repair hither and say you are not fit.>
46 <    We would not understand what was most fit,>
42 <    And, sister, as the winds give benefit>
43 <    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,>
34 <  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.>
49 <    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!>
66 <  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit>
34 <  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,>
48 <    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.>
48 <    Thus much the business is: we have here writ>
40 <    And I beseech you instantly to visit>
48 <    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,>

64 <    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.>
64 <    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.>
64 <    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.>
64 <    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.>
64 <  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]>
64 <      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]>
52 <    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt>
50 <  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,>
44 <    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.>
43 <    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt>
40 <    So full of artless jealousy is guilt>
65 <    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt>
23 <    Of general assault.>

44 <  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?>
52 <    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant>
45 <  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.>
35 <  Osr. I know you are not ignorant->
43 <    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.>
47 <    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.>
49 <    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,>
47 <    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent>
51 <      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.>
25 <    And call it accident.>
48 <  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.>
66 <  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent>
48 <    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.>
41 <    How in my words somever she be shent,>
42 <    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,>
52 <      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;>
31 <  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.>
44 <    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement>
16 <  Ham. Judgment!>
49 <    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment>
50 <    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment>
54 <    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.>
47 <    Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,>
47 <    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment>
44 <    And enterprises of great pith and moment>
42 <    Is not to stir without great argument,>
44 <    This grave shall have a living monument.>
55 <  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!>
44 <    Contagious blastments are most imminent.>
42 <    Which is not tomb enough and continent>
43 <    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?>
10 <    spent.>

40 <    Against the which a moiety competent>
47 <    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,>
43 <    Do I impart toward you. For your intent>
27 <    To give it due content.>

44 <    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,->
40 <    Makes mouths at the invisible event,>
46 <    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,>

64 <    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.>
45 <    No reckoning made, but sent to my account>
45 <    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,>
57 <    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'>
45 <  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.>
39 <    That thou so many princes at a shot>
50 <    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot>
49 <    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot>
8 <    not.>
40 <    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,>
68 <  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not>
23 <  Laer. O, fear me not!>
68 <  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not>
39 <    To you in satisfaction; but if not,>
29 <  Both. My lord, we will not.>
51 <  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.>
49 <    Of all their conference. If she find him not,>
69 <  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not>
62 <  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.>
43 <    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,>
67 <    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not>
41 <    Looking before and after, gave us not>
29 <  Ham. Nay, that follows not.>
11 <    it not?>
40 <    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.>
45 <    Try what repentance can. What can it not?>
50 <  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.>
17 <    might it not?>
69 <    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not>
69 <  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not>
31 <    insert in't, could you not?>
47 <    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not>
23 <  Ham. Nay, I know not.>
53 <  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;>
60 <  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not>
30 <  Ros. No indeed are they not.>
26 <  Guil. My lord, I cannot.>
29 <  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.>
21 <  Ham. Sir, I cannot.>
67 <  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot>
64 <  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot>
48 <         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot>
35 <  Both. My lord, from head to foot.>
46 <    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,>
31 <    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.>
55 <  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?>
32 <           'As by lot, God wot,'>
25 <  Ghost. I find thee apt;>
53 <    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,>
43 <    But farewell it, for I will use no art.>
36 <  Queen. More matter, with less art.>
28 <    A face without a heart,'>
45 <    The head is not more native to the heart,>
49 <    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,>
63 <    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;>
47 <    This something-settled matter in his heart,>
27 <    And I am sick at heart.>
44 <    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,>
50 <    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!>
42 <    It warms the very sickness in my heart>
50 <    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart>
47 <    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;>
43 <    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,>
44 <    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,>
39 <    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,>
49 <    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.>
60 <    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.>
68 <  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart>
67 <  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start>
58 <  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.>
45 <    Lest with this piteous action you convert>
64 <    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.>
41 <    To make it truster of your own report>
39 <    And gave you such a masterly report>
41 <    And with a look so piteous in purport>
47 <      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport>
40 <    As it is common for the younger sort>
49 <    That she should lock herself from his resort,>
49 <  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.>
49 <    To hear of it. They are here about the court,>
50 <    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court>
52 <  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,>
56 <         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'>
51 <    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.>
51 <      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.>
42 <    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,>
60 <  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?>
66 <    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last>
39 <    By laboursome petition, and at last>
52 <    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past>
41 <    A couch for luxury and damned incest.>
54 <    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.>
11 <  A Priest.>
53 <    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,>
42 <    And when you are desirous to be blest,>
56 <  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.>
30 <  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?>
32 <    Queen. O, confound the rest!>
48 <    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!>
46 <    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,>
29 <    Give me one poor request.>
41 <    This heavy-headed revel east and west>
52 <    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!>
39 <    The ocean, overpeering of his list,>
36 <                        Enter Ghost.>
37 <                         Enter Ghost.>
64 <                                                     Exit Ghost.>
64 <                                                     Exit Ghost.>
64 <                                                     Exit Ghost.>
24 <  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!>
53 <    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,>
42 <  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;>
49 <    Whose motive in this case should stir me most>
64 <    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most>
46 <    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post>
64 <                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].>
51 <      None wed the second but who killed the first.>
45 <    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.>
44 <      When second husband let me be accurst!>
42 <    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.>
43 <    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust>
47 <      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;>
50 <    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust>
50 <      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,>
44 <    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,>
51 <    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out>
42 <    Make you to ravel all this matter out,>
55 <    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out>
24 <  Ham. My fate cries out>
40 <    By indirections find directions out.>
33 <    philosophy could find it out.>
27 <    Treachery! Seek it out.>
44 <    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out>
43 <    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,>
50 <    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without>
57 <  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.>
41 <    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,>
14 <    it. Adieu.>
46 <    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!>
66 <  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You>
64 <    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You>
68 <    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou>
30 <    I'll rant as well as thou.>
29 <      For husband shalt thou->
63 <  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!>
23 <    'Thus didest thou.'>
60 <    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.>
69 <    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you>
67 <    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you>
26 <    Who hath reliev'd you?>
37 <  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.>
20 <    So, proceed you.>
66 <    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you>
46 <    Moreover that we much did long to see you,>
52 <    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;>
50 <    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you>
56 <  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,>
67 <    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you>
52 <  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,>
46 <    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,>
20 <    my leave of you.>
34 <  King. He made confession of you;>
45 <    Where you may see the inmost part of you.>
21 <  Hor. I beseech you.>
24 <  Ham. I do beseech you.>
46 <    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.>
51 <  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.>
59 <  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.>
43 <    And he to England shall along with you.>
47 <    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?>
33 <  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,>
45 <    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.>
67 <  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;>
44 <    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.>
13 <    Mark you,>

48 <    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.>
40 <  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.>
47 <    And that in way of caution- I must tell you>
29 <    But let me hear from you.>
52 <  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?>
35 <  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?>
28 <  Both. We'll wait upon you.>
64 <    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you>
67 <    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you>
28 <    What I have said to you.>
47 <  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?>
44 <    With all my love I do commend me to you;>
65 <  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.>
24 <    hath sent me to you.>
52 <    May do t' express his love and friending to you,>
23 <    This marvel to you.>
45 <  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?>
63 <  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,>
50 <    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,>
67 <  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,>
67 <  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,>
66 <  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.>
22 <    have sent for you.>
57 <    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,>
48 <    Before my daughter told me), what might you,>
19 <    I'll visit you.>
54 <    You, as your business and desires shall point you,>
58 <  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.>
37 <  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?>
18 <  Ham. I pray you.>
22 <  Ham. Arm'd, say you?>
49 <    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?>
44 <  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?>
27 <  King. Who shall stay you?>
26 <  Queen. I shall obey you;>
66 <    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;>
46 <    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,>
25 <  Other. But is this law?>
46 <  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.>
51 <    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!>
45 <    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw>
42 <    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw>
47 <    Will not debate the question of this straw.>

49 <  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.>
47 <    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew>
58 <  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew>
65 <    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,>
38 <  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.>
32 <    it is but a shadow's shadow.>
40 <            And I a maid at your window,>
46 <    But I have that within which passeth show->
49 <    Not of that dye which their investments show,>
66 <    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow>
50 <      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below>
58 <  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.>
49 <    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;>
27 <    Therefore let's follow.>
54 <    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?>
46 <    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now>
69 <    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now>
34 <  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.>
29 <  Ham. What's the matter now?>
21 <  Ham. What hour now?>
24 <    I be so able as now.>
34 <  Ham. If she should break it now!>
16 <    See you now->
48 <    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,>
24 <  Laer. Have at you now!>
47 <    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!>
24 <  King. Not that I know.>
29 <    And tell you what I know.>
41 <         How should I your true-love know>
47 <    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know>
51 <    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;>
50 <  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,>
48 <    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,>
30 <  Oph. My lord, I do not know,>
47 <    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know>
46 <    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know>
20 < and then, you know,>
52 <      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;>
50 <    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow->
40 <         His beard was as white as snow,>
48 <    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,>
45 <    See what a grace was seated on this brow;>
59 <    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow>
39 <    Does by their own insinuation grow.>
41 <    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow>
42 <    And in the cup an union shall he throw>
50 <    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw>
56 <  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.>
45 <    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,>
50 <    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow>
47 <    That it went hand in hand even with the vow>
41 <    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax>
49 <    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?>
68 <    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,>
48 <    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!>
53 <    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;>
11 <  Ber. Say->
45 <    How does your honour for this many a day?>
52 <    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?>
42 <    And do such bitter business as the day>
45 <    And it must follow, as the night the day,>
40 <    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,>
47 <    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,>
48 <    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.>
49 <    The changeling never known. Now, the next day>
50 <    From the first corse till he that died to-day,>
47 <    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day>
48 <    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay>
49 <    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay>
64 <  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.>
46 <    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,>
48 <    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,>
45 <    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,>
33 <          The hart ungalled play;>
57 <  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.>
58 <  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.>
34 <  King. What do you call the play?>
26 <  Pol. Give o'er the play.>
42 <    But if you hold it fit, after the play>
64 <                                                Prepare to play.>
36 <    Laertes before you fall to play.>
37 <  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?>
47 <    For they are actions that a man might play;>
64 <  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.>
47 <    And will this brother's wager frankly play.>
40 <    Let Hercules himself do what he may,>
28 <  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.>
42 <    My soul is full of discord and dismay.>
51 <    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,>
48 <    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.>
27 <    Look you, I'll go pray.>
8 <    say->
11 <    O, say!>
69 <  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?>
31 <    i' th' university, you say?>
57 <    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,>
67 <    answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,>
64 <    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)>
34 <  Clown. Very strangely, they say.>
47 <    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.>
27 <  Osr. Nothing neither way.>
49 <    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way>
33 <  King. Give me some light! Away!>
35 <          Thus runs the world away.>
44 <    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.>
42 <    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.>
45 <    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!>
30 <  King. O Gertrude, come away!>
44 <    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away>
40 <  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away>
41 <    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,>
27 <  Ber. See, it stalks away!>
52 <  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!>
33 <  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?>
47 <    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,>
31 <  Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.>
46 <    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,>
49 <    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?>
48 <    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by>
46 <  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.>
43 <    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.>
53 <  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby>
22 <    Here in the lobby.>
30 <    the stair, into the lobby.>
38 <    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.>
40 <    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?>
40 <    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,>
41 <    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,>
65 <    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,>
37 <      Here stooping to your clemency,>
36 <    That he is open to incontinency.>
50 <    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy>
46 <    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,>
25 <  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.>
22 <    the players ready.>
19 <    make you ready.>
39 <  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.>
25 <    Thou know'st already.>
38 <    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,>
32 <  Ham. How is it with you, lady?>
29 <    One word more, good lady.>
32 <  King. How do you, pretty lady?>
37 <    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,>
41 <    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.>
64 <  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,>
45 <         For if the King like not the comedy,>
37 <    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.>
55 <  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?>
53 <  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.>
45 <    The natural gates and alleys of the body,>
51 <    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body>
68 <  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.>
23 <    All my smooth body.>
49 <    With which she followed my poor father's body>
44 <    And makes each petty artire in this body>
44 <    Unto the voice and yielding of that body>
49 <         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.>
48 <    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;>
25 <  Guil. But we both obey,>
69 <    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They>
9 <    they?>
64 <                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they>
63 <  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they>
24 <    This warlike volley.>
11 <  Ham. Why,>
11 <  Ham. Why,>
11 <  Ham. Why?>
42 <    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.>
27 <    humanity so abominably.>
27 <  Ham. I embrace it freely,>
59 <    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,>
21 <  Ham. How strangely?>
53 <    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,>
67 <  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely>
42 <      On wholesome life usurp immediately.>
13 <    waterfly?>
34 <  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.>
41 <    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.>
51 <    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly->
44 <    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.>
25 <    Yes, faith, heartily.>
44 <  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;>
50 <  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.>
39 <    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.>
40 <    And for your rapier most especially,>
66 <  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully>
58 <    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly>
41 <    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,>
44 <  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.>
27 <    Most free in his reply.>
66 <    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply>
56 <    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,>
45 <    You do not understand yourself so clearly>
61 <  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.>
69 <  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.>
54 <    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,>
23 <  Hor. Most constantly.>
62 <  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.>
45 <  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.>
45 <    Been struck so to the soul that presently>
61 <    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly>
68 <    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my>
62 <  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my>
66 <    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my>
65 <    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my>
68 <    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my>
68 <    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my>
67 <    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my>
66 <    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my>
39 <    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.>
37 <      Directly seasons him his enemy.>
65 <  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any>
66 <  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many>
42 <    And hath abatements and delays as many>
58 <  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?>
41 <           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)>
67 <  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy>
43 <    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,>
43 <    And there did seem in him a kind of joy>
47 <      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy>
42 <    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,>
41 <      The violence of either grief or joy>
48 <    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.>
50 <      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.>

44 <  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.>
67 <    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary>
42 <    As England was his faithful tributary,>
52 <  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!>
44 <    When in your motion you are hot and dry->
66 <    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry>
38 <    Well ratified by law and heraldry,>

41 <      Purpose is but the slave to memory,>
40 <    And these few precepts in thy memory>
36 <    Yea, from the table of my memory>
44 <    That are so fortified against our story,>
28 <  Ham. Sir, a whole history.>
49 <  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!>
69 <  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?>
46 <    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.>
47 <      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,>
23 <    Of man and country->
37 <    A station like the herald Mercury>
66 <    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,>
45 <    With this regard their currents turn awry>
68 <  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:>
47 <    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;>
44 <    Is not this something more than fantasy?>
41 <  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,>
15 <  Ham. Ecstasy?>
34 <    This bodiless creation ecstasy>
39 <    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,>
53 <    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!>
21 <    Than to entreaty.>

27 <    tragedians of the city.>
42 <      Of violent birth, but poor validity;>
47 <    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality>
67 <    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity>
40 <      In neither aught, or in extremity.>
43 <    From me, whose love was of that dignity>
39 <    Passing through nature to eternity.>
34 <    To his unmast'red importunity.>
51 <    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;>
40 <    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,>
47 <      For women's fear and love holds quantity,>
52 <    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,>
39 <    If you desire to know the certainty>
25 <    To youth and liberty.>
45 <    That they may seem the taints of liberty,>
41 <      Thy natural magic and dire property>
23 <    Over the nasty sty!>
46 <    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;>
67 <  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty>
41 <    That live and feed upon your Majesty.>
51 <    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.>

51 <    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.>
